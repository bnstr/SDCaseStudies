## Designing an automation framework for testing the Live mode feature on an iPhone camera

### High-level approach:

##### 1. Key Components
* **Test Cases**:

  * **Capture Photo in Live Mode**: Validate that Live mode captures a photo with a video clip.
  * **Switch Modes**: Test switching between Live mode and standard photo mode.
  * **Verify Motion and Quality**: Ensure the video clip accurately represents the motion and meets quality standards.
* **Page Objects**:

  * **CameraPage**: Manages interactions with the camera interface, including Live mode controls.
  * **GalleryPage**: Access and validate captured photos and videos in the gallery.
* **Utilities**:

  * **Image Comparison**: Compare captured images to expected results.
  * **Video Analysis**: Check the quality and length of the captured video.
  * **Logging and Reporting**: Track test execution, results, and issues.

##### 2. Tools and Technologies
* **Testing Frameworks**:

  * **XCTest**: Native iOS testing framework integrated with Xcode.
  * **Appium**: Cross-platform testing tool for mobile applications.
* **Device Management:

  * **BrowserStack** or **Sauce Labs**: Cloud services for accessing a variety of iOS devices and versions.
  * **Xcode Simulator**: For local testing on different iOS versions.
* **Programming Languages**:

  * **Swift**: For XCTest-based testing.
  * **Python**: For Appium-based testing with a variety of libraries.
* **Continuous Integration**:

  * Jenkins or GitHub Actions: Automate test execution and integrate with CI/CD pipelines
##### 3. Framework Architecture
* **Core Modules**: 
  * **Test Scripts**: Define and execute test scenarios.
  * **Page Objects**: Represent and interact with UI elements.
  * **Utilities**: Provide support functions such as logging, image comparison, and video analysis.
* **Directory Structure**:
